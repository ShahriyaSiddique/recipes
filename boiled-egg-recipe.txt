INGREDIENTS
4â€“8 large eggs

RECIPE PREPARATION
Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Using a slotted spoon, carefully lower eggs into water one at a time. Cook 10 minutes, maintaining a gentle boil. Carefully transfer eggs to a bowl of ice water and let cool until just slightly warm, about 2 minutes.

Gently crack eggs all over and peel, starting from the fat end containing the air pocket.
